            No Car Lot – That's right, you don't need to come to our car lot because we don't have one! Instead, we will bring vehicles to you, and cut the expenses of large office buildings and lots. Of course, we pass all those savings on to you.
            Working on Your Behalf – We're not just trying to push any vehicle on you to make a commission. Instead, we are representing you when finding the perfect vehicle and negotiating the best terms.
            Financing – In addition to helping you find the right vehicle, we'll also provide you with unbeatable financing terms. You can get financed directly through us, or we can help you to find the right financial institution to work with to keep your rates low.
            Price Match Guarantee – You won't find a better price on the vehicle you want, we guarantee it. If you do find a better price anywhere in the Philadelphia area, we'll match it or beat it right away.
            Free Delivery – Once you've chosen the vehicle you want, we'll have it delivered right to your home, free of charge. This way you don't have to worry about getting a ride to pick up your new car.
            Discounts – We will help find any discounts you qualify for, including corporate or union discounts, so you can save as much money as possible.
            Manufacturer Specials – If an auto manufacturer is giving any specials on specific cars, and you choose one of them, we'll pass on the savings to you!
            Any Make or Model – We lease all makes and models so no matter what you are looking for, we can get it for you.
